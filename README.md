# FileRenamer

Just a simple utility that I made for myself to use with Adobe After Effects

Feature:
  - Delete files that are 4Kb and less
  - Delete files with .xmp extension
  - Give common name to files in folder and rename them in ascending order, like "frog-1", "frog-2" and etc

Usage:
  - Drag and drop folder(s) to the app window.
  - Enter a common name for files
  - Click ok
